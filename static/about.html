    <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
    <p>This study aims to investigate the potential of using date palm wood as a biofuel in Oman through the process of bio-wood gasification. The research focuses on the development and optimization of a bio-wood gasifier that can efficiently convert date palm wood into a usable and sustainable energy source. The study will also assess the environmental and economic impact of utilizing date palm wood as a biofuel, as well as the feasibility of implementing bio-wood gasification technology on a larger scale in Oman. The findings of this research will contribute to the advancement of renewable energy technologies in the region and provide valuable insights for policymakers and stakeholders in the energy sector.</p>
